Write a program that sets a password as ‘changeme’ and asks the user to enter the password and keeps asking until the correct password is entered and then says ‘Accepted’. 
The program should count how many attempts the user has taken and tell them after they have been accepted. 
Extra Challenge: 
If the user takes more than 5 attempts the program should say, ‘Access denied, please press enter to exit and contact security to reset your password’


password=("changeme!")
count=0
while count<=5:
userinput=input(“enter password”)
count=count+1
if user==password:
print(“bingo”)
break
elif userinput!=password:
print(“try again”)
print(“Attempt Number”+str(count))
if count==5:
print(“Access denied”)
break
    guess =input("Enter your password = ")
    if guess == password:
        print("accepted")

    else:
        print("Declined")
