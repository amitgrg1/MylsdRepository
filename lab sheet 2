What will the output be from the following code?
num = 4
num*=2
num1=num+2
num1+=3
print(num1)

answer: 
1. num = 4
2. num = 8 (4*2)
3. num1 = 10 (8 + 2)
4. num1 = 13 (10+3)
print the result 13

What do the following lines of code output? Why do they give a different answer?
print(2 / 3)
print(2 // 3)
answer: the first will evaluate 2/3 so answer =0.666666
             the second is alpha numeric statement so it prints 0
All of the variable names below can be used. But which of these is the better variable name to use?
A       a       Area      AREA        area      areaOfRectangle       AreaOfRectangle

Answer: AreaOfRectangle because it follows the programming convention and clear and need no explanation what it is for. 
Which of these variables names are not allowed in Python? (More than one might be wrong.)
apple      APPLE     Apple2        1Apple   account number          account_number       account.number    accountNumber       fred  Fred   return   return_value   5Return
GreatBigVariable   greatBigVariable   great_big_variable   great.big.variable     2x 
Answer: 1Apple , 5Return, 2x:  { variable name must start with Alphabet }
account number: { space is not allowed }
return: is keyword not a variable

Explain the mistake in the following code:
radius = input("Radius:")
x = 3.14
pi = x
area = pi * radius ** 2
Answer: the code above should calculate the area of circle but it will give error because the Inputted radius value is accepted as string not an integer type
Explain the mistake in the following code:
x = 4
y = 5
a = 3(x + y)
Answer: here the last statement 3(x+y) is called which is not allowed because the function and variable name can't start with number.

Explain the mistake in the following code:
radius = input(float("Enter the radius:"))
Answer: The string value can't be converted to floating
Why does this code not calculate the average?
print(3 + 4 + 5 / 3)
Answer: Here with the statement the opening and closing parenthesis is missing the correct code is print ( (3+4+5)/3)
Consider the following code:
x = 19.93
y = 20.00
z = y – x
print(z)
The output is 0.0700000000028    Why ?   
Improve the code so that the output is to two decimal places.
Answer: According the memory space (size) allocated for floating point it will display the above answer. The

 print "%.2f " % (z)

Find at least three compile-time errors:
int x = 2
Print (x, squared is, x * x)
xcubed = x *** 3

Answer:  line 1- int is a conversion function. To assign value 2 to x the expression should be x=2
Line no 2- uses of capital letter P, the syntax of print is invalid
Line no 3 – for cubic value evaluation the syntax used  *** is invalid
The correct code is 
x = 2
print ("x is %d, square is %d " %(x, x *x))
xcubed = x ** 3
Find two run-time errors:
from math import sqrt
X = 2
Y = 4
print(“The product of “, x, “and”, y, “is”, x + y)
print(“The root of their difference is “, sqrt(x – y))

Answer: the 3rd line calculate product as (x + y) will give error it should be x * y
The 4th line should does not fine the difference of root of x and y it should be (sqrt(x) – sqrt(y) )

Write statements to prompt user for their name and age
Write a print statement to output:
Hello ____, next year you will be ____ years old!
Answer:
 name = input ("Enter your Name: ")
age = int (input ("Enter your Age: "))
age +=1
print ("Hello %s, next year you will be %d years old!" % (name, age) )


Given that radius is 2 and area is calculated as 12.5678, use string format operators to print the values of the variables radius and area so that the output looks like this:
Radius is: 	          2
Area is:	  12.57

Answer:
Radius = 2
Area = Radius ** 2 * 3.142
print ("Radius is:      %d \nArea is:     %.2f" %(Radius, Area))
